## OpenClassrooms Project 4 - SEO optimisation

In this project, I started to see how everything works behind the scene. I find out there is so mutch to learn about :
- Accessibility (colors, size, aria...)
- How to be scalable by Google robot and be the first in the research.

I got a given website with a very bad SEO that needed to be improved (a lot...).

I write 2 reports :
- [Analysis report](https://github.com/Bol2riZH/La_Panthere/files/10154934/Reungoat_Matthieu_1_rapport_analyse_072022.pdf) (how to improve SEO and list of points that has to be corrected)
- [Optimisation report](https://github.com/Bol2riZH/La_Panthere/files/10154889/Reungoat_Matthieu_3_rapport_optimisation_072022.pdf) (difference between before and after)


### I spend a lot of time to read about this very important topic and i am now able to work along with it.
